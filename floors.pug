  h2.section-header Bonfire
  p Come home, fair traveler, rest your feet. You must be tired from your journey (up four [ok, it's really three] flights of stairs). Have a rest whispering answers to the NYT crossword and spelling bee, pondering nonsensical philosophical questions, pondering sensical pragmatic questions, or listening to steampunk weirdcore complex vampire tunes on our beloved sound system. 
  p Fear not, travelers with allergies, for we like our kitchen clean and certified nut (and many other allergens) free. Enjoy the cadence and cuisine of over 9.81 languages and cultures, and contribute your own!
  p We like to party in many ways. If you're feeling like venturing out into the world of ocean voyages, fairy carnivals, and reckless bears, participate in one of our several ongoing D&D or other TTRPG campaigns. If, instead, you wish to strut your stuff at a late-night gathering filled with late 2010's music, perhaps in costume on Halloween or not in costume on not Halloween, you will find a place here. We contain multitudes.
  p Come, friend, and flourish. For it's always morning on bonfire.

  p The Gaymer floor of Random. It's home for a large collection of consoles, video games, and board games. Our floor is proudly loud and never sleeps. We feast on McDonald's and homemade pasta. Our communal fridge and cupboard is filled with ingredients and is only getting bigger! We love plushies and our lounge is filled with them. We are home to the best bathroom in Random that has been recently renovated and both of our bathrooms are equipped with bidets. You will often find us planning the next revolution against the filthy Random Hall government. We only house fourteen soldiers but the clam lives within many others around the dorm and the MIT campus!

  p welcome to black hole, the second floor of random hall on the 290 side! along with the largest number of [scream] per capita at MIT, we’re home to four mannequins, two cats, and some quantity of people.
  p bh was named for its ability to mysteriously suck anyone who walks by into whatever exciting happenings is going on on the floor, never to be seen again.
  p we’re best described as “wholesome sketchy.” with at least one bh resident awake at every hour of the day, you can generally find someone in bhitchen (black hole kitchen). they might be cooking, building, climbing, scheming, planning out an elaborate floor event, or even doing *gasp* math! maybe they’ll ask if you want to go climbing or practice spinning arts on the roofdeck.
